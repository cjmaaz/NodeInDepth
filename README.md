# Node.js In-Depth

A comprehensive learning resource covering Node.js core concepts and advanced topics. This project is designed to help developers understand Node.js from the ground up, with beginner-friendly explanations, practical examples, and in-depth explorations of how Node.js works under the hood.

## What You'll Learn

This documentation covers:

- **Core Concepts**: Event loop, asynchronous programming, module system, streams, buffers, and EventEmitter
- **Advanced Topics**: Process management, clustering, performance optimization, and security
- **Practical Skills**: Building real-world applications with Node.js best practices

### Available Concepts

- **[Buffers](buffers/)** - Binary data handling, memory management, and buffer operations
- **[EventEmitter](emitters/)** - Event-driven programming, pub/sub patterns, and asynchronous event handling

## Documentation

### Getting Started

- [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) - Prerequisites, setup, and configuration
- [Configuration Files](docs/configuration-files.md) - Understanding .nvmrc and .npmrc

### Core Concepts

- [Buffers](buffers/) - Binary data handling and memory management
- [EventEmitter](emitters/) - Event-driven programming and asynchronous patterns

## How to Use This Resource

1. Start with the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide to set up your development environment
2. Read the [Configuration Files](docs/configuration-files.md) documentation to understand project setup
3. Explore core concepts:
   - Begin with [Buffers](buffers/) to understand binary data handling
   - Learn [EventEmitter](emitters/) for event-driven programming patterns
4. Work through each concept folder:
   - Read the comprehensive README.md for theory and problem statements
   - Study basic examples (typically `app.js`) for core operations
   - Explore advanced examples for deeper understanding
   - Review enterprise-level examples for production patterns
5. Practice with the code examples provided in each section
6. Experiment with your own variations to deepen your understanding

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript (ES6+ recommended)
- Familiarity with command line/terminal basics
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
