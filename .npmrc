# engine-strict
# When set to true, npm will refuse to install any package that claims to not be
# compatible with the current Node.js or npm version. This setting works in conjunction
# with the "engines" field in package.json.
#
# Why this is important:
# - Prevents installing packages that may not work with your Node.js version
# - Catches version incompatibilities early in development
# - Ensures all team members use compatible versions
# - Avoids runtime errors caused by version mismatches
#
# Without this setting, npm only shows warnings but still installs incompatible packages,
# which can lead to subtle bugs that are hard to debug.
# Few commands:
# npm i -g npm (Install the latest version of npm)
# (-g flag is to indicate that this package will be installed globally and won't get added to current repo's package.xml)
