# .nvmrc - Node Version Manager Configuration File
#
# This file specifies which Node.js version should be used for this project.
# It works with version managers like nvm (Node Version Manager), fnm (Fast Node Manager),
# and others.
#
# How to use:
# 1. Install nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
# 2. Navigate to this project directory
# 3. Run: nvm use
#    (This will automatically read this file and switch to the specified version)
#
# Why use a .nvmrc file:
# - Ensures all developers use the same Node.js version
# - Prevents "works on my machine" issues caused by version differences
# - Documents the required Node.js version for the project
# - Can be automated in CI/CD pipelines
#
# Note: Different version managers (nvm, fnm, volta, asdf, etc.) all recognize this file format.
# The format is simple: just the version number on a single line.
# Few useful nvm commands are:
# nvm install --lts (Installs the lts version of node)
# nvm use --lts (Uses the lts version of node)
# nvm ls and ls-remote (Lists the installed/remote version of node)
# nvm uninstall 23.1.1 (remove the installed version of node, can also pass the --lts flag if you want to remove the lts version)

24.12.0
# Latest Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) version as of December 2025
# LTS versions are recommended for production use due to their stability and extended support.
